# Please note that in order to implement this functionality securely
# without any additional privilege on the part of Cuckoo, the below
# scripts should simply create and remove files with the names of
# the IP address passed as an argument in a directory which only
# cuckoo is permitted to write to.  Then a daemon running as root
# can simply perform inotify watches on the directory and run the
# iptables rules itself, ensuring the IP addresses provided are
# in a preconfigured list.
